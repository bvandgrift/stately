# Stately

A minimal, elegant state machine for your ruby objects.

## Making a stately start

Stately is a state machine for ruby objects, with an elegant, easy-to-read DSL. Here's an example showing off what Stately can do:

```ruby
class Order
  stately start: :processing do
    state :completed do
      prevent_from :refunded

      before_transition from: :processing, do: :calculate_total
      after_transition do: :email_receipt

      validate :validates_credit_card
    end

    state :invalid do
      prevent_from :completed, :refunded
    end

    state :refunded do
      allow_from :completed

      after_transition do: :email_receipt
    end
  end
end
```

Stately tries hard not to surprise you. When you transition to a new state, you're responsible for taking whatever actions that means using `before_transition` and `after_transition`. Stately also has no dependencies on things like DataMapper or ActiveModel, so it will never surprise you with an implicit `save` after transitioning states.

## When to use stately

Often, you'll find yourself writing an object that can have multiple states. Tracking these states can usually be done either:

* By hand (i.e. adding a string column in the db and storing the current state there).
* Via a state machine of some kind. [state_machine](https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine) is a popular one that I've used quite a bit, which has a lot of advanced features (most of which I've never used).

Stately exists in a middle space between the two options. The goal of stately is to make the most common case, where you just need to track state and react appropriately when switching those states, easy.

## Design goals

* Minimalist. Stately tries to solve the most common use case: tracking the current state and handling transitions between states.

* No magic. In other words, if you're using, say, ActiveRecord, stately won't hook in to activerecord callbacks. This requires you to be more explicit and perhaps more verbose, but I think it helps with readability and reduces surprises. See the Examples section below for what this looks like when in an ActiveRecord environment.

* Syntax that is as self-documenting as possible. Someone not familiar with Stately should be able to understand what happens when an object's state is changed just by reading the DSL.

## Getting started

Either install locally:

```shell
gem install stately
```

or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem stately
```

Be sure to run `bundle install` afterwards.

The first step is to add the following to your object:

```ruby
stately start: :initial_state, attr: :my_state_attr do
  # ...
end
```

This sets up Stately to look for an attribute named `my_state_attr`, and initially set it to `initial_state`. If you omit `attr: :my_state_attr`, Stately will automatically look for an attribute named `state`.

## Defining a state

States make up the core of Stately and define two things: the name of the state (i.e. "completed"), and a verb as the name of the method to call to begin a transition into that state (i.e. "complete"). Stately has support for some common state/verb combinations, but you can always use your own:

```ruby
class Order
  stately start: :processing do
    state :my_state, action: transition_to_my_state
  end
end

order = Order.new
order.transition_to_my_state
```

## Transitions

A "transition" is the process of moving from one state to another. You can define legal transitions using `allow_from` and `prevent_from`:

```ruby
state :completed do
  allow_from :processing
  prevent_from :refunded
end
```

In the above example, if you try to transition to `completed` (by calling `complete` on the object) from `refunded`, you'll see a `Stately::InvalidTransition` is raised. By default, all transitions are allowed.

## Validations

While transitioning from one state to another, you can define validations to be run. If any validation returns `false`, the transition is halted.

```ruby
state :completed do
  validate :validates_amount
  validate :validates_credit_card
end
```

Each validation is also called in order, so first `validates_amount` will be called, and if it doesn't return `false`, then `validates_credit_card` will be called and checked.

## Callbacks

Callbacks can be defined to run either before or after a transition occurs. A `before_transition` is run after validations are checked, but before the `state_attr` has been written to with the new state. An `after_transition` is called after the `state_attr` has been written to.

If you're using Stately with some kind of persistence layer, sych as activerecord, you'll probably want an `after_transition` that calls `save` or the equivalent.

```ruby
class Order
  stately start: :processing do
    # ...

    state :completed do
      before_transition from: :processing, do: :before_completed
      before_transition from: :invalid, do: :cleanup_invalid
      after_transition do: :after_completed
    end
  end

  private

  def after_completed
    save
  end
end
```

A callback can include an optional `from` state name, which is only called when transitioning from the named state. Omitting it means the callback is always called.

Additionally, each callback is executed in the order in which it's defined.

## Example: using Stately with ActiveRecord

Let's say you are modeling a Bicycle object for your rental shop and you're using ActiveRecord. A Bicycle has two states: `available` and `rented`. Using stately, you could define this as the following:

```ruby
class Bicycle < ActiveRecord::Base
  stately start: :available do
    state :rented, action: :rent do
      after_transition do: :save
    end
  end
end
```

When Bicycle is first instantiated, its `state` column is set to the string `available`. If you want to rent the Bicycle, you'd call `bicycle.rent`, which would update the `state` column to be the string `rented` and then call the ActiveRecord method `save`.

As you can see, Stately is slightly more verbose than other state machine gems, but with the upside of being more self-documenting. Additionally, it doesn't hook into ActiveRecord's callback chains, and instead requires you to explicitely call `save`.

## Requirements

Stately requires Ruby 1.9. If you'd like to contribute to Stately, you'll need Rspec 2.0+.
